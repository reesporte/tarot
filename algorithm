HOW TO READ TAROT CARDS
(based on my interpretation from a howcast video with questionable costume choices)

1. Have a question, topic or focus in mind

2. Shuffle cards

3. pick four cards in a diamond pattern:
                1.romance
              /           \
        4. career         2. Finances
              \           /
            3. health and happiness

4. turn over cards in order, if it faces the reader, it's a good card, representing good things,
    if it doesn't, then it's a bad card, representing bad things

5. Interpret!
    if negative, then give random choice from negative interpretations
    if positive, then give random choice from positive interpretations
    If suit == major, give fortune from fortune_telling
